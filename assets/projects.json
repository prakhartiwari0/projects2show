        "projectInfo": "Designed with Creativity for kids, Arito is a WebApp built for practising arithmetic skills. I built a Python GUI App on the same idea for my little sister when I newly learned that language, but after starting Web Development, I decided to build a better version on the web that would be more accessible and joyful. Have helped a father's daughters, a brother's sister, and don't know how many others through this nice little app."

        "projectInfo": "A Browser Extension to create custom keyboard shortcuts in a website. I used to face this problem of repetitive clicking of certain elements that was frustrating, I started wondering if there's a chrome extension to create keyboard shortcuts to click on them. To my surprise, I didn't find anything like that, so I thought why not build it then? I talked to a few people and got a positive response. Built the basic version in about 1.5 months, in Vanilla JS, no framework (because I didn't know one yet), with a lot of effort, and launched it on Product Hunt. The users are growing steadily, already crossed 100 users, such a good feeling to have something out in the market used by so many people!"
